Hello,
I would like to apply to your Software Developer position. Just take a look at my resume (attached) to see all my experience in the web development field and in Python in particular.
In a nutshell, I have 10 years of experience in webdev, of which last two are in Python+Django. Actually, I am language agnostic, which means that language by itself is not very significant for me. I'm more interested in building application architecture, developing, coding, solving business tasks. I like to use technology rather than making things. On the other hand, I like to create experimental applications for fun. I see problems in business and real life that could be solved. For example, right now I'm working on one service for human translation using Amazon MTurk and alike services. As a side project, I made an object-oriented Twitter API library. I'm interested in going to an interview or personal meeting. Feel free to contact me by phone or email.
Regards,
Sergey Vasilyev
