Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Amit Singh, currently pursuing my B-Tech – Electrical & Electronics. As I am in the procedure of finding the right job, I identified your company and find it the right place as I will have the scope of being a part of the technical team, where I can execute my electrical knowledge, which is my area of interest.

I have been an active member of the academic project – Capillary Evaporate Cooler & have got a practical knowledge during this project tenure. I have also attended an Industrial Training program at National Thermal Power Corporation, where we experienced & learnt about the steam cycle.

I would like to be a part of this reputed firm, where I can utilize my skills, knowledge & talent. This would be the right opportunity and I strongly believe that if given a chance I will prove myself and contribute to the growth & success of the organization.

Thank you for your consideration.

(Amit Singh)
